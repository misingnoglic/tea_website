Le Marche Spice Rooibos,Rooibos,EnjoyingTea,Random Tea Sale,https://www.enjoyingtea.com/lemaspro.html,"Rooibos, rosehip shells, almond pieces, dried apple, hibiscus,  cinnamon spice",4,212,"The Le Marche Spice Rooibos is a top grade herbal tea from South Africa. This delicious tea includes Rooibos, rosehip shells, almond pieces, dried apple, hibiscus, and cinnamon spice.

Rooibos, meaning Red Bush in Afrikaans, is grown at the altitude of 2000 feet above sea level in the Cedarberg region. Fermentation of the Rooibos turns the leaves from green to deep red and gives a slight sweet note. When brewed this tea produces a reddish orange liquid with a sweet, fruity, and spicy taste.

Research has shown Rooibos tea to be a rich natural source of antioxidants with a high level of flavonoids. The absence of caffeine makes it an ideal drink, even at night.
